Generate flood maps and raster masks using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. 

Created by Francine Soriano for IPA. Sample images show impacts of Typhoon Tino (4 Nov 2025) to Bago City, Philippines.

For the SAR noise remove, better despeckling can be achieved by using SNAP. The despeckling in this GUI using the uniform filter is for demonstration purposes only. Better despeckling will also result in better water masks.")
